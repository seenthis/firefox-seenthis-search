seenthis.net IncSearch Add-ons for Firefox

This is an adaptation of https://github.com/onozaty/firefox-delicious-incsearch for seenthis.net, huge thx to onozaty for his original work :)

Run seenthis search from source
-----------------------

1. Locate your Firefox [profile folder](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder)
2. Open `extensions/` folder, create if it doesn't exist.
3. Create a new text file and put the full path to your development folder inside.
(e.g. `C:\firefox-seenthis-search\` or `~/firefox-seenthis-search/`). Windows users should retain the OS'
slash direction, and everyone should remember to include a closing slash and remove any
trailing spaces.
4. Save the file with seenthis search ID as it's name `seenthis_search@seenthis.net`
